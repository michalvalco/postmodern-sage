# Wisdom Library

This is the core philosophical content of A Postmodern Sage—organized by theme, not by tradition or thinker.

## How This Works

Each thematic category contains two types of content:

**Essays** (1,000-3,000 words)  
Deep philosophical explorations of specific questions or challenges. These are the substantial pieces—the ones that require sitting with a cup of coffee and thinking carefully.

**Insights** (100-500 words)  
Brief reflections, observations, or frameworks. The distilled wisdom—insights that don't need lengthy exposition to be useful.

## Current Categories

### Ethics in Practice
*Navigating moral complexity without religious certainty*

How do you make ethical decisions when traditional moral frameworks no longer hold? This section explores virtue ethics, consequentialism, deontology, and Christian personalism—but always in service of *actual* ethical dilemmas you face.

**Topics include:**
- Professional ethics in AI and tech
- Moral decision-making frameworks
- Virtue cultivation in contemporary life

### Transcendence
*The vertical dimension in a horizontal world*

Transcendence doesn't require traditional religion—but it does require taking seriously that humans orient themselves toward something beyond mere survival and pleasure. This section explores the transcendent without dogmatism.

**Topics include:**
- The sacred in secular life
- Contemplative practice beyond religion

- Hope without guarantees
- Faith as trust rather than certainty

### Identity & Authenticity
*Who you are when culture won't tell you*

When identity is no longer given by tradition but chosen (or curated), what does it mean to be authentic? This section wrestles with selfhood, narrative identity, and the tension between autonomy and belonging.

**Topics include:**
- Narrative identity and the storied self
- Authenticity vs. self-creation
- Cultural identity in diaspora
- Professional identity beyond productivity
- The relational constitution of selfhood

## How to Navigate

**If you have a specific question:** Use the category that best fits your concern. Most questions will span multiple categories (as they should—wisdom isn't compartmentalized).

**If you're browsing:** Start wherever resonates. Follow the internal links. Let one piece lead to another.

**If you're contributing:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on submitting content.

## A Note on Organization

These categories aren't rigid. An essay on "finding purpose through ethical work" could fit in Ethics, Purpose, or Identity. We place it wherever seems most natural—and use cross-references liberally.

Philosophy resists neat filing. That's fine. The structure exists to help you find what's useful, not to impose false order on complex thought.
