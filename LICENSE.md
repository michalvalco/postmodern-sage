## Why This License?

Wisdom should be shared freely. But it should also be attributed honestly.

This license ensures that:
1. Anyone can use, adapt, and build upon this content
2. Original contributors receive proper credit
3. Derivative works remain open and accessible
4. Commercial use is permitted (because wisdom workers deserve to eat too)

We chose ShareAlike (rather than allowing proprietary derivatives) because collective wisdom should remain collectively accessible.

If you have questions about how this license applies to your specific use case, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
