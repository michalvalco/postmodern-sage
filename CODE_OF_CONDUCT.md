# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

A Postmodern Sage exists to foster genuine philosophical dialogue and mutual learning. That requires space where people can engage honestly—sometimes even uncomfortably—with difficult questions.

But honest engagement doesn't mean unrestrained hostility. You can critique ideas rigorously while treating people generously. That's the standard here.

## Core Principles

### 1. Intellectual Honesty

**We value:**
- Admitting uncertainty when you don't know
- Changing your mind when evidence warrants
- Acknowledging complexity rather than forcing simplicity
- Representing opposing views accurately before critiquing them

**We reject:**
- Strawman arguments
- Deliberate misrepresentation
- Arguing in bad faith
- Certainty performed for status

### 2. Charitable Interpretation

When someone's position seems absurd or offensive, first assume you might be misunderstanding them.

Ask clarifying questions before dismissing. Give people the benefit of the doubt (at least once).

This doesn't mean accepting everything uncritically—it means *understanding* before judging.

### 3. Respectful Disagreement

You can—and should—disagree strongly. But do it well.

**Good disagreement looks like:**
- "I see your point about X, but I think Y because..."
- "That framework doesn't account for Z—how would you address that?"
- "I've found the opposite to be true in my experience. Here's why..."

**Bad disagreement looks like:**
- "That's obviously stupid."
- "Only an idiot would think..."
- "Anyone who believes X is clearly..."

Critique the *idea*, not the person. Always.

### 4. Contextual Sensitivity

People come from different philosophical, religious, and cultural backgrounds. What feels self-evident to you might be genuinely foreign to someone else—and vice versa.

That's... actually valuable. It means we have something to learn from each other.

Don't assume your framework is universal. Don't dismiss traditions you haven't seriously engaged with.

### 5. Inclusive Dialogue

This community welcomes:
- Religious believers and atheists
- Conservatives and progressives
- Academics and autodidacts
- People just starting their philosophical journey and those decades into it

What unites us is the *search* for wisdom, not arrival at identical conclusions.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Some things don't belong here—no matter how philosophically justified you think they are:

### Prohibited Conduct

**Personal Attacks**  
Attacking someone's character, intelligence, or worth rather than engaging their ideas.

**Harassment**  
Repeated unwelcome contact, intimidation, or targeting of specific individuals.

**Discrimination**  
Content or behavior that demeans people based on identity (race, gender, sexuality, disability, religion, nationality, etc.).

**Bad Faith Engagement**  
Trolling, deliberate provocation, or participation solely to disrupt rather than contribute.

**Dogmatism Disguised as Wisdom**  
Presenting sectarian religious or political dogma as universal wisdom without acknowledging its particular commitments.

**Intellectual Dishonesty**  
Plagiarism, falsification, or deliberate misrepresentation of sources or positions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- All repository content (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Communication in community spaces (forums, chats, events)
- Representation of this community in external spaces

Basically: If you're engaging with this community in any capacity, these standards apply.

## Enforcement

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **Document it** — Screenshot or save the relevant content
2. **Report it** — Open a private issue or email the maintainers (if available)
3. **Include context** — What happened, when, and who was involved

Reports will be reviewed confidentially within 48 hours.

### Response Process

Depending on severity, responses may include:

**Minor Violations (First Instance)**  
- Private warning
- Request for public apology or correction
- Temporary restriction from commenting

**Moderate Violations (Pattern of Behavior)**  
- Public warning
- Temporary ban (1-4 weeks)
- Removal of problematic content

**Severe Violations**  
- Permanent ban
- Report to hosting platform (GitHub)
- Notification to relevant authorities (in cases of threats or illegal activity)

### Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was unjust:
- Submit an appeal within 14 days
- Explain why you think the decision was wrong
- Provide any relevant context

Appeals will be reviewed by a different maintainer than the one who made the original decision.

## Positive Community Culture

Beyond avoiding harm, we want to *build* something generative.

**Practices we encourage:**

**Ask Good Questions**  
Sometimes a well-posed question contributes more than a confident answer.

**Share Uncertainty**  
"I'm not sure, but here's how I'm thinking about it..." is often more valuable than false certainty.

**Recommend Generously**  
Point people toward resources, thinkers, or frameworks that genuinely helped you—even if they differ from your current views.

**Acknowledge Growth**  
When someone changes their mind or refines their thinking, celebrate that rather than mocking their previous position.

**Steward the Space**  
If you see someone new struggling to articulate a thought, help them sharpen it rather than dismissing them.

## A Note on Philosophical Disagreement

This repository draws from multiple traditions: Christian personalism, virtue ethics, existentialism, phenomenology, pragmatism, and others.

You don't have to agree with all (or any) of these frameworks. You don't have to be religious to contribute. You don't have to be secular.

What matters is:
1. Honest engagement with ideas
2. Respect for people
3. Commitment to genuine wisdom-seeking (not just winning arguments)

We're building a space where atheists and theists, conservatives and progressives, academics and practitioners can actually *talk* to each other—not just past each other.

That's rare. It's also worth protecting.

## Questions About This Code

Wondering if something constitutes a violation? Not sure how to apply these principles in a specific situation?

**Open an issue with the label `code-of-conduct-question`** and we'll clarify.

## Amendments

This Code of Conduct will evolve as the community grows. Substantial changes will be announced and open for discussion before implementation.

## Summary

**Be honest. Be kind. Be rigorous. Be humble.**

Critique ideas sharply. Treat people generously. Admit what you don't know. Listen more than you speak.

If you can do that, you're welcome here.
