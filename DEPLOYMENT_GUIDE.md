cd /home/claude/postmodern-sage
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: A Postmodern Sage v1.0.0"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/postmodern-sage.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Configure Repository Settings

**On GitHub, go to Settings:**

### 4. Announce Launch

**Where to Announce:**

- Medium (if you have an audience there)
- Academic networks (if applicable)
- Relevant subreddits (r/philosophy, r/TrueAtheism, r/ExChristian, etc.)
- Your email list (if you have one)

**Launch Message Template:**

```
I've spent years wrestling with meaning, purpose, and ethics in the 21st century—
as both an academic (AI ethics, theology, philosophy) and someone trying to actually live well 
in an algorithmic age.

Today, I'm open-sourcing that wrestling.

"A Postmodern Sage" is a GitHub repository of philosophical wisdom for contemporary challenges:
- AI ethics and human flourishing
- Purpose beyond productivity
- Authentic identity in the age of curation
- Digital minimalism as spiritual practice
- Virtue ethics for the attention economy

It's not self-help. It's not life hacks. It's philosophy that touches real life.

And it's collaborative—contributions welcome.

If you're navigating the same tensions between ancient wisdom and contemporary chaos, 
this might be useful.

**Why:** Makes the repository useful to broader audiences beyond academics.

### Weeks 9-12: Make It Actionable

**Develop 3-5 practical guides:**

**Why:** Philosophy without practice is just theory. This is where wisdom becomes operational.

### Months 4-6: Build Community

**Encourage contributions:**
- Respond to all issues promptly
- Accept good pull requests quickly
- Feature contributor work prominently
- Create discussion threads for key topics

**Why:** Collective wisdom is more robust than individual expertise.
