## Versioning Philosophy

Because wisdom doesn't follow traditional software versioning, here's how we think about versions:

**MAJOR version (X.0.0)** — Fundamental restructuring, significant philosophical evolution, or community governance changes

**MINOR version (1.X.0)** — New content categories, substantial additions to existing sections, or feature expansions

**PATCH version (1.0.X)** — Individual content additions, typo fixes, clarifications, or minor organizational improvements
