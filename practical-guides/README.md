# Practical Guides

Wisdom divorced from practice isn't wisdom—it's abstraction.

## What Lives Here

These are actionable frameworks, practices, and tools grounded in philosophical depth. Not quick fixes or life hacks... but *methods* for integrating wisdom into actual life.

Think of these as bridges between theory and practice—ways to make philosophical insight operational.

## Current Guides

*This section will be populated as guides are developed. Check back regularly.*

## In Development

The following practical guides are being prepared:

**Decision-Making in Moral Complexity**  
A framework for navigating ethical dilemmas when principles conflict and stakes are high. Draws from virtue ethics, casuistry, and Christian personalism.

**Daily Practices for Cultivating Presence**  
Concrete routines (not just meditation) for maintaining attention and awareness in a distraction-saturated world.

**A Reading Guide for Philosophical Depth**  
How to read philosophy well—not just for information, but for transformation. Includes recommended sequences and engagement practices.

**Conversation Starters for Meaningful Dialogue**  
Questions and prompts that move beyond small talk without being awkwardly intense. For building genuine connection.

**Reflection Prompts for Self-Examination**  
Structured questions for examining your life, choices, and direction—without descending into paralyzing introspection.

**Digital Minimalism Framework**  
Practical steps for reclaiming attention, curating your information diet, and using technology intentionally rather than reactively.

**Building a Personal Rule of Life**  
How to create sustainable rhythms and practices that support flourishing—adapted from monastic tradition for contemporary secular life.

**Discernment Process for Major Life Decisions**  
A structured approach to vocational, relational, or geographic decisions when the stakes are high and the path unclear.

**Cultivating Intellectual Humility**  
Practices for remaining open to being wrong, engaging charitably with opposing views, and maintaining curiosity over certainty.

**Ethics Check Protocol for Professional Contexts**  
A quick framework for evaluating the ethical dimensions of professional decisions, especially useful in tech and business.

## Format

Each practical guide includes:

### 1. Context & Rationale
*Why this practice matters. What problem it addresses.*

### 2. Core Framework
*The main structure, method, or approach—explained clearly.*

### 3. Step-by-Step Implementation
*Concrete instructions for actually using this in your life.*

### 4. Common Obstacles & How to Navigate Them
*What typically goes wrong, and how to adjust.*

### 5. Variations & Adaptations
*How to modify for different contexts, temperaments, or constraints.*

### 6. Integration with Other Practices
*How this connects to broader patterns of flourishing.*

### 7. Further Resources
*Books, essays, or thinkers that go deeper.*

## How to Use These Guides

**Don't just read them.** Try them.

Philosophy as spectator sport is worthless. These guides only matter if they touch your actual life.

So:
- Pick *one* guide at a time
- Actually implement it for 2-4 weeks
- Notice what works and what doesn't
- Adapt as needed
- Then move to another if it's useful

Accumulating practices without integration is just another form of consumerism.

## Submission Guidelines

Contributing a practical guide?

**Requirements:**
1. **Test it yourself first** — Don't share untested theory. What have you actually used?
2. **Be specific** — "Cultivate presence" is vague. "Morning reflection protocol: 10 minutes, specific prompts, evaluation criteria" is actionable.
3. **Acknowledge limitations** — No practice works for everyone. Note who this does (and doesn't) serve well.
4. **Ground it philosophically** — Why does this practice matter? Connect it to deeper commitments about human flourishing.
5. **Make it sustainable** — Practices that require heroic willpower aren't sustainable. Build in realistic expectations.

See full contribution guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## A Note on "Self-Help"

These guides draw from philosophical and spiritual traditions—virtue ethics, Christian monasticism, Stoicism, contemplative practice—but they're not "self-help" in the typical sense.

The goal isn't optimized productivity or personal branding. The goal is *flourishing*—which sometimes looks like doing less, not more. Like being content rather than constantly improving.

So these practices serve wisdom, not efficiency. Character formation, not life-hacking.
