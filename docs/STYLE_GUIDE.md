# Content Style Guide

For contributors to A Postmodern Sage

## Voice & Tone

### Core Principles

**Conversational but Substantive**  
Write like you're talking to an intelligent friend over coffee—someone who can handle complexity but doesn't have your specific expertise.

**Honest About Difficulty**  
Don't pretend complex things are simple. Don't offer easy answers to hard questions. Complexity is fine—obscurity is not.

**Humble About Limitations**  
Admit what you don't know. Acknowledge opposing views fairly. Recognize the limits of your perspective.

**Grounded in Experience**  
Theory matters, but connect it to real life. Use examples, narratives, observations. Philosophy should touch actual existence.

### What to Avoid

**Corporate/Tech Jargon**  
- ❌ "Leverage," "unlock," "disrupt," "in the ever-evolving landscape"
- ✓ Use plain language. Say what you mean directly.

**Academic Obscurity**  
- ❌ Unnecessarily dense prose that obscures rather than illuminates
- ✓ Clarity without simplification. Make difficult ideas accessible.

**Toxic Positivity**  
- ❌ "Just be positive!" "Everything happens for a reason!" "Choose joy!"
- ✓ Honest about difficulty while avoiding despair.

**Dogmatic Certainty**  
- ❌ "The answer is obviously X" "Anyone who thinks Y is wrong"
- ✓ "Here's how I think about this..." "One approach might be..."

**Performative Wisdom**  
- ❌ Platitudes without depth, quotes without context, spiritual-sounding emptiness
- ✓ Actual insight from genuine engagement with difficult questions

## Structure & Format

### Essays (1,000-3,000 words)

**Required Sections:**
1. **Context** — What question/challenge prompted this?
2. **Core Content** — Your main exploration
3. **Practical Application** — How does this touch real life?
4. **Further Reflection** — Questions for the reader
5. **About the Author** — Brief bio (50-100 words)
6. **Tags & Date**

**Optional Sections:**
- Related Content (internal links)
- Further Reading (external resources)
- Common Objections
- Personal Narrative

### Insights (100-500 words)

**Format:**
- Single focused observation or framework
- Brief, distilled, potent
- Must stand alone (no "Part 1 of...")
- Tags and date at the end

### Contemporary Challenges

**Required Sections:**
1. **The Problem** — Clear articulation
2. **Why It Matters** — Stakes and consequences
3. **Philosophical Context** — How wisdom traditions address (or don't address) this
4. **Practical Approaches** — Actual strategies
5. **Further Questions** — Prompts for continued reflection

### Practical Guides

**Required Sections:**
1. **Context & Rationale**
2. **Core Framework**
3. **Step-by-Step Implementation**
4. **Common Obstacles**
5. **Variations & Adaptations**
6. **Integration with Other Practices**
7. **Further Resources**

## Writing Mechanics

### Sentence Length

Vary dramatically. Short, punchy sentences. Then longer, more complex constructions that develop an idea through subordinate clauses and qualification.

Single-word sentences work too.

Mix it up.

### Paragraphs

Generally keep them short (2-5 sentences for web reading). But occasionally use longer paragraphs when the thought requires sustained development.

Break for emphasis.

### Lists

Use sparingly. Prefer prose and paragraphs. When you do use lists:
- Make each item substantial (not just keywords)
- Ensure parallel structure
- Keep the number reasonable (3-7 items usually)

### Headers

Use headers to guide navigation, but don't over-organize. Philosophy resists rigid structure.

**Good use:** Breaking major sections  
**Bad use:** Header for every new thought

### Emphasis

Use **bold** for key concepts or definitions. Use *italics* for emphasis or foreign terms.

Don't overuse either. Let the prose carry the weight.

### Citations

When referencing specific works or thinkers:
- Author, *Title*, year (if relevant)
- Link to source when available
- Provide enough context that readers can follow up

No formal academic citation style required—just clarity.

## Philosophical Approach

### Draw from Multiple Traditions

We're not sectarian. Christian personalism, virtue ethics, existentialism, phenomenology, pragmatism, Stoicism—all are welcome.

But be clear about where you're drawing from and acknowledge the particular commitments of each tradition.

### Engage Opposing Views Fairly

Before critiquing a position, represent it accurately. Steel-man, don't straw-man.

### Balance Theory and Practice

Philosophy divorced from life is just abstraction. Every theoretical claim should connect to lived experience somehow.

### Acknowledge Complexity

Real questions rarely have simple answers. If you're providing a framework, note its limitations.

### Use Examples Wisely

Abstract concepts benefit from concrete illustration—but don't let examples substitute for argument.

## Language Guidelines

### Pronouns

First-person ("I've found...") and second-person ("You might notice...") are both fine. Just be genuine.

Third-person plural ("We") is okay when speaking about shared human experience—but avoid the "royal we" or false universalization.

### Contractions

Use them naturally. "Don't," "can't," "it's"—these make prose conversational without being casual.

### Vocabulary

Use the right word, even if it's difficult—but explain technical terms when needed.

Don't use fancy vocabulary for its own sake. Clarity over impressiveness.

### Metaphors

Good metaphors illuminate. Bad metaphors confuse.

Use them when they genuinely help understanding—not just for style.

## Content-Specific Guidelines

### When Writing About Religion

- Respect religious traditions while remaining accessible to secular readers
- Don't assume religious commitment, but don't dismiss it either
- Be clear about when you're speaking from within a tradition vs. about it
- Avoid both apologetics and reductionism

### When Writing About Technology

- Balance critique with recognition of genuine benefits
- Avoid both technophobia and uncritical enthusiasm
- Ground observations in actual experience, not hypotheticals
- Connect to broader questions of human flourishing

### When Writing About Personal Experience

- Vulnerability is valuable—but not exhibitionism
- Use personal narrative to illuminate universal themes
- Don't assume your experience is universal
- Balance specificity with relatability

## Quality Standards

### Before Submitting, Ask:

**Is it honest?**  
Does this reflect genuine engagement with difficulty, or am I performing wisdom?

**Is it clear?**  
Can an intelligent non-specialist follow this?

**Is it grounded?**  
Does this connect to real life, or is it just abstraction?

**Is it charitable?**  
Have I represented opposing views fairly?

**Is it substantial?**  
Does this offer actual insight, or just repackage common knowledge?

**Is it humble?**  
Have I acknowledged limitations and uncertainty where appropriate?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. The "Life Coach" Voice
Overly enthusiastic, unnaturally positive, performatively motivational.

**Bad:** "You've got this! Just believe in yourself and amazing things will happen!"  
**Good:** "This is difficult. Here's one way to think about it."

### 2. The "Academic Lecture" Voice
Dry, distant, unnecessarily complex, speaking down to readers.

**Bad:** "The phenomenological reduction facilitates access to transcendental consciousness..."  
**Good:** "Here's what Husserl was getting at..."

### 3. The "Self-Help Guru" Voice
Seven steps to enlightenment. Quick fixes. Oversimplified frameworks.

**Bad:** "Follow these five simple steps to find your purpose!"  
**Good:** "Here's a framework that might help you think about purpose more clearly."

### 4. The "Despair Spiral" Voice
Everything is terrible, nothing matters, collapse is inevitable.

**Bad:** "Technology has destroyed human connection and there's nothing we can do."  
**Good:** "Technology changes connection in complex ways—here's how to navigate that."

**Remember:** The goal isn't perfect prose. The goal is wisdom that actually helps people live better.

Write like you care about the reader. Write like you've struggled with these questions yourself. Write like truth matters but certainty is rare.

That's the voice we're after.
