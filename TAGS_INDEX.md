```yaml
tags: [buddhism, mindfulness, technology, attention economy]
```

These tags enable:
- **Cross-referencing** — Find related content across categories
- **Thematic exploration** — Follow topics that interest you
- **Tradition tracking** — See how different philosophies address similar issues
- **Discovery** — Stumble upon connections you wouldn't expect

---

## Suggest New Tags

1. Open an [issue](https://github.com/michalvalco/postmodern-sage/issues)
2. Suggest the tag and rationale
3. Link to relevant content
